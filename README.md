<!-- 
    1. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
    2. Make you own Theme.
    3. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.
    4. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

    What is it built with?
        Maybe use Codepen or Replit to make sure that it can run. Ideally have an embed that I can plug into my portfolio website. Possibly extend this later though.
    What can it do?
        Its supposed to be a message generator? So generate a message... Don't overdo it.
    Make a timeline and avoid the temptation to build things that arent required (prevent scope creep)
        8 - 9 plan and begin
        9 - 10 script
        10 - 11
        11 - 12 polish with HTML + CSS
        Finish by Lunchtime.

    Planning to extend this using web scraping later
        scrape wikipedia for game quotes
        scrape wikipedia for game genres
        scrape wikipedia for game titles in that genre
