## Other Notes

I'm aware the size of this "project" is more suitable for a gist. However, exploration and the following additional features would not be possible in gist format:

- Practicing making thorough README.md documentation
- Learning how to import JSON data into a js file
- Figuring out how to use and configure ESLint
- Experimenting with project structure
