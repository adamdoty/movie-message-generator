# JavaScript Syntax - Portfolio Project

## Prompt

1. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
2. Make you own Theme.
3. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.
4. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Theme Ideas

- Cat quote generator
- Game quote generator

## Plan

### What is it built with?

Just Node.js to run the simple js script.

For the data I will generate some mock data using [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

### What can it do?

Its supposed to be a message generator? So generate a message... Don't overdo it.

### Timeline

Make a timeline and avoid the temptation to build things that arent required (prevent scope creep)

|Hour   | To Do                     |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
|8 - 9  | plan and begin            |
|9 - 10 | script                    |
|10 - 11| make a nice README / docs |
|11 - 12| polish                    |

Finish by Lunchtime.

## Extending the App

Maybe use Codepen or Replit to make sure that it can be run by folks. Ideally have an embed that I can plug into my portfolio website.

Consider rebuilding using web scraping later:

- scrape wikipedia for game quotes
- scrape wikipedia for game genres
- scrape wikipedia for game titles in that genre
